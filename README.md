# Introduction2NeuralNetworks
An interactive Neural Network Playground, providing students with a set of tools to explore and visualize various activation functions, datasets, and model training. This Streamlit app is designed to provide students with a no-code introduction to neural networks. 

## Contents
The application provides the following content

### Activation Functions

Multiple Activation functions are provided and visualized in the main page

### Datasets

Visualize datasets generated using scikit-learn's `make_regression` and `make_classification` functions. Gain insights into the characteristics of datasets commonly used in neural network training.

## Network Architecture

Showcase Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with various architectures. Visualize the structure of neural networks with different layer sizes and understand how the architecture influences the learning process.

## Training

Get an explanation of the model training process. Learn about concepts involved in training a neural network.

## Quiz

Challenge yourself on a predefined dataset and Maximize your training score
